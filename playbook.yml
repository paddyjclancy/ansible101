- hosts: web
# Host is to define the name of your host machine, group or all servers
# In this example we are targeting server called web

  gather_facts: yes
# Gathering facts before performing any tasks

  become: true
# Become is used to get root permission to perform any tasks that may require admin access

  tasks:
# Tasks are executed in order, one at a time, against all Servers matched by the host pattern
# Every task should have a name, which is included in the output from running the playbook
# The goal of each task is to execute a module, with very specific arguments.

  - name: Install nginx
  # We are installing nginx on our web server
